soduku.py:

Sudoku solver that implements backtracking search with forward checking using the minimum remaining value heuristic

Input a string that represents the board from left to right starting from the top row. Represent an empty space with a 0.

For example, run "python3 sudoku.py 003020600900305001001806400008102900700000008006708200002609500800203009005010300"

puzzle.py:

Agent that solves the 8-puzzle game using depth-first search (DFS), breadth-first search (DFS), and A* search. Run the program specifying which search you want to use and a list of integers with commas and without spaces to represent the board. Represent the empty space with a 0. Use "dfs" to use depth-first search, "bfs" to use breadth-first search, and "ast" to use A* search.

For example, run "python3 puzzle.py bfs 0,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1"
